        <p class="main desc">For a graphic design course I did at university, I was told to design a poster for a famous designer, Bouroullec's 
		exhibition at the Vancouver Art Gallery.  </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Initial process</h2>

        <p class="color-description">
          I began by looking through their work and designs. I wanted to reflect their style in some way on the poster. I found a few images of their work 
		that I could use and started designing the poster on illustrator. This was the first time I didn't sketch before designing, and I wanted 
		the image to be the main element of the poster; hence I started aligning the text blocks to the image for a clear visual flow. The image 
		below shows the flow I was going for.

        <p class="color-description">
           I wanted to experiment with font this time. I generally stick to specific fonts that I like and which are neutral. Looking at how Bouroullec 
		experiments with their design, it motivated me to go ahead and use an unconventional font like copperplate. It was a huge risk to use only 
		copperplate for all text, but I believe it was worth taking the risk as it gave me the confidence to experiment.

        <p class="color-description">
           I think I did a good job on the poster and showed my visual design skills pretty well. However, one that I can improve on is by exploring 
		Bouroullec's style even more and not just relying on their work's image.
