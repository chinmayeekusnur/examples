        <h2 class="sub-heading">Overview</h2>

        <p class="main desc">Meraaki is a logo I created for a bakery based in Mumbai, India. The brief I got was to include an element in 
		the logo, that when a person sees the logo, it tells them that it is a bakery or patisseries logo. The founder also told me 
		to keep it as simple as possible because her baking style is very minimalistic, and she wanted that to be illustrated in the logo. </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Initial process</h2>

        <p class="color-description">
          I started off by going through all the cakes that she makes. Then, I went and saw how she bakes to get a sense of her personality and how I could 
		reflect that in the logo I create. My takeaways from that meeting were that she is so happy while baking and has fun with whatever she makes. 
		Furthermore, I saw how elated she was after baking the cake, and her face lit up when she lit a candle on the cake. Looking at that, I realized 
		that this can be the element that I illustrate on the logo. Her sense of precision and attention to detail is commendable, and I feel like it 
		was essential for me to witness that before I start designing.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Brainstorming- Sketching</h2>

        <p class="color-description">
         My next step was to brainstorm different ideas; hence I started sketching some logos on paper and made sure to keep the candle as an element while 
		designing. Here are a few sketches I made and personally liked the fourth design the most because it was a perfect combinationof simplistic 
		yet very grounded to the founder's habits and values. Furthermore, I thought that the fourth design depicted her brand beautifully.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Colour selection</h2>

        <p class="color-description">
         I was very sure from the beginning that I wanted to use black and white as dominant colours. However, I was afraid it might not depict her creative side very well. However, I believe that these two colours' thought is deeply rooted in her work culture and nature. In this case, I used black to show the elegance and simplicity of her personality and white to illustrate the innocence and purity of her soul that drives her to 
	be such an amazing patisserie chef. Lastly, I had to add a pop of colour to show her happiness and passion for this company therefore, I added 
	yellow for the candle.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Type Selection</h2>

        <p class="color-description">
           After deciding on the colours, I had to look for a suitable typeface to match the brand's aesthetic. While looking for fonts, I was sure I 
		wanted to experiment a little and find one with rounded edges with shorter kerning to illustrate the icing movement. I then decided on 
		this font called 'Zag Regular,' which was the closest to what I was looking for.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Reflection</h2>

        <p class="color-description">
           Overall, I was pretty happy with the result, and I believe that my reasoning does justice to the design. Furthermore, the client was also pretty 
		happy. If I had to improve the design in any way, I would try to incorporate one more colour, preferably a pastel one, because I feel like 
		that would add more depth to the design. Otherwise, I am satisfied with the logo design.
