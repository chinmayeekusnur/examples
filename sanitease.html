        <h2 class="sub-heading">Overview</h2>

        <p class="main desc">I created this logo for one of my father's ventures in India, Sanitease. It is an initiative to donate biodegradable sanitary 
		napkins to underprivileged girls and women in the rural parts of India. I was given a simple brief that the logo should have a story 
		behind it. </p>

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Initial process</h2>

        <p class="color-description">
          Starting the ideation of this logo was a bit challenging for me because it was difficult for me to illustrate a story in just one logo. 
		However, I started scrolling through Pinterest but didn't find substantial inspiration. Then, one day, while talking to my mother, 
		I noticed this red dot she wears on her forehead every day, a bindi, a beauty mark many Indian women wear. So I thought it would be 
		a nice story to incorporate that in my design. It also indicates a period dot, which I wanted to embrace because women's menstrual 
		cycle is still taboo in rural India.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Brainstorming- Sketching</h2>

        <p class="color-description">
         My next step was to brainstorm different ideas; hence I started sketching some logos on paper and made sure to keep the red dot as an element while 
		designing. Here are a few sketches I made and personally liked the fourth design the most because it was a perfect combinationof simplistic 
		yet very grounded to the founder's habits and values. Furthermore, I thought that the fourth design depicted her brand beautifully.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Colour selection</h2>

        <p class="color-description">
         I was very sure from the beginning that I wanted to use black and white as dominant colours. However, I was afraid it might not depict her creative side very well. However, I believe that these two colours' thought is deeply rooted in her work culture and nature. In this case, I used black to show the elegance and simplicity of her personality and white to illustrate the innocence and purity of her soul that drives her to 
	be such an amazing patisserie chef. Lastly, I had to add a pop of colour to show her happiness and passion for this company therefore, I added 
	yellow for the candle.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Type Selection</h2>

        <p class="color-description">
           After deciding on the colours, I had to look for a suitable typeface to match the brand's aesthetic. While looking for fonts, I was sure I 
		wanted to experiment a little and find one with rounded edges with shorter kerning to illustrate the icing movement. I then decided on 
		this font called 'Zag Regular,' which was the closest to what I was looking for.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Reflection</h2>

        <p class="color-description">
           Overall, I was pretty happy with the result, and I believe that my reasoning does justice to the design. Furthermore, the client was also pretty 
		happy. If I had to improve the design in any way, I would try to incorporate one more colour, preferably a pastel one, because I feel like 
		that would add more depth to the design. Otherwise, I am satisfied with the logo design.
