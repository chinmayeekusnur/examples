        <h2 class="sub-heading">Overview</h2>

        <p class="main desc">Covinise is a microsite that lets all individuals living in Vancouver, BC access their COVID vaccine appointments easier. 
		Through a few clicks, you are able to check all information needed to prepare for your vaccination, accessible locations to obtain 
		vaccines, and get post-vaccination information.</p>

        <p class="main-1">This micro-site puts your comfort level first when it comes to getting vaccinated. You are able to access the schedule for 
		each vaccine for each location. That not only will save up your time but also make sure you are satisfied with your safety choices.</p>

        

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Problem</h2>

        <p class="main desc">
          For a course I took, Web design and development, one assignment told us to make an e-commerce microsite responsive using HTML and CSS. In May 2020, 
		when people started to get their COVID vaccines across the globe, I thought of making a microsite that allows people to book their covid 
		vaccines. The main issue was that this platform had to cater to every age group and kind of people in British Columbia. It was pretty 
		interesting to work on this because there were hardly a few websites used to book vaccine appointments back then.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="landing-page-description">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Initial process</h2>

        <p class="color-description">
          I saw that there wasn't one common platform 
          available in BC back then for people to book their vaccine slot. A site that 
          gives a lot of information to people about the vaccines available and reduces 
          the hassle of going through different portals to book a vaccine slot for 
          themselves. So firstly, I started with the colour selection. It was super 
          important to define the website's tone, and choosing the correct colours was 
          essential to indicate that. 
        </p>
	      
      </section>

      <section class="color-grid">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Color selection</h2>
        <p class="main desc">
          Color was the first thing I thought of while making the initial style guide. 
          It was a bit hard to select the colours as my aim was to spread as much 
          positivity possible through this site. The reason is that we all waited 
          for the vaccine for almost a year, and now it's finally here. Initially, 
          we thought of using blue extensively, even though blue is elegant and would 
          please the user's eye. However, I wanted to use the color that depicted a 
          meaning and feeling. The image below was my inspiration. The idea stemmed 
          from the fact that there is always a ray of light in the most hopeless time. 
          The color green will help us grow with the help of bright yellow. 
        </p>

          Here is my interpretation of these colors and how their connotation works in 
          this concept-

            <div>
              <p class="color-description">Green denotes growth, good health and visual balance. Vaccines balances the evil effects of the pandemic
                and improve sour immunity for good health.

                Yellow also denotes good health and is a strong contrast against dark green. This bright 
                colour will help energize us.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Personas</h2>
        <p class="color-description desc">
          These persona's below helped me identify the key aspects I have to focus on. My main takeaway was that I have to make an intuitive 
		website as it will be made for a wide range of age groups. Moreover, these people may or may not be comfortable using technology. 
		Therefore, a simple, as well as an informative site is what I had to work on.

	     <h2 class="sub-heading">Wireflow</h2>
	     <p class="main desc">
		  I started my process by brainstorming by writing the possible user flow for the website, as seen below. 
		  The main issue was how to lay the information on the site; because there was 
		  only one <a class="link" href="https://www.vaccines.gov/">reference</a> for 
		  me earlier, it got a bit hard to decide the flow of the whole microsite. 
		  This is because it took time for me to scan and understand the most relevant 
		  details I could add to simplify the booking process and because this is a 
		  microsite. However, after researching multiple medical appointment pages, I 
		  curated the current flow as a lead designer. The first two flows seen in the 
		  figure are the main flows I ideated on, and by comparing which flow fits 
		  the scope of the project, I combined the two flows and made the third flow.
		  We were continuously trying to strike the perfect balance on the negative 
		  space around and how the negative space makes the site powerful and lets 
		  the user breathe through the whole process of booking an appointment.  
		</p>

     <section class="landing-page-description">
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Wireframes and Mockup</h2>
        <p class="main desc">
          Using the third flow as the backbone of the microsite, I first made a basic, preliminary low-fidelity mockup on paper, 
		as shown below, to have a visual outline website could look. 
        </p>

	<p class="caption">Prilimnary sketches of the decided user flow. </p>

        <p class="main-1">
          Then, I designed high-fidelity mockups of Figma first to have a blueprint of the site to reference when I implement. 
		Next was to code the website using HTML, CSS and Javascript. We then tested our website on different mobile 
		applications and people and fixed any responsiveness errors we encountered. Click 
		<a class="link" href="https://www.sfu.ca/siat/student_projects/iat339/ckusn/Covinize-Firm-Chinmayee/covinize-company/#aboutus">here</a> to view the website.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Landing page</h2>
        <p class="main desc">
          The landing page was meant to be very simple so that people of all age groups 
          can use it well. So one thing that we made sure of was to use the word 'Book' 
          multiple times, as you can see in the gif below. This is because once the user 
          reads the word 'book' multiple times, they will register the word and subconsciously 
          know that the next step to the site will be to click on the 'book' button. 
        </p> 

        <p class="main-1">
          Additionally, on this page, an image of a man with the vaccine barrel is added to 
          strike a visual balance on the page with the heavy font placed on the left-hand 
          side. Also, the pop of yellow on the screen creates good contrast and breaks the 
          monotony of the page. The home page gives basic information about covinize and 
          frequently asked questions. We also added three images, as seen below, to encourage 
          people to get vaccinated because visual elements attract users more, and it helps 
          them understand the idea that is to be conveyed.

          As seen below, here the user can select the desired location to get the vaccine.  
          I used a simple grid with the address and button to avoid confusion. As it was the 
          first time I was coding a webiste, and the whole concept of responsiveness 
          was pretty new to me, I tried to keep the layout as simple as possible, yet it has
          all the necessary information.

        <p class="main desc">
          We have a form which is one of the most important elements of our micro-site. 
          As the lead designer, I spent the most time in designing this page in order to make  
          it pretty easy for the user to use, be it a 19 year old teenager or a 70 year senior 
          citizen. I tried to have minimal information on the page so that the most important 
          information is highlighted, which can be seen below in the gif. There is also a 
          conformation page in the end, where the date and time selected is highlighted. 
          Furthermore, there are basic instructions present for the user to remember before 
          coming for the appointment.

        <h2 class="sub-heading">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="main">
          This was the first project that I have hand-coded by myself with my teammate. 
          It was a great experience to know the process of converting designs  
          to actual code. As it was our first time, there are a few errors with 
          responsiveness and overall spacing. In addition, the form and footer design could be better 
          because this was the first time for me to transfer designs from Figma to code; 
          I had less time to focus on the site's design elements. Now, in hindsight, I 
          would fix those nitty-gritty things to make the site much better.
        </p>

        <p class="main-1">
          Nevertheless, I am happy that the concept behind using colour and interactions 
          in a particular way made our project successful. Selecting a vaccine booking 
          system instead of a general e-commerce website made me stand out amongst everyone 
          else doing this course. I believe that this wasn't something I had many references 
          to go through before making the microsite. In the end, I am very proud of my 
          teammate Firm and I for designing and coding this microsite.
